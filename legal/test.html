    <h2>
        2. Roles and Responsibilities    </h2>
    <p>2.1 <strong>Parties’ roles.</strong> If European Data Protection Laws or the LGPD applies to either party’s processing of Customer Data, the parties acknowledge and agree that with regard to the processing of Customer Data, Mailchimp is a processor acting on behalf of Customer (whether itself a controller or a processor). For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA shall not apply to instances where Mailchimp is the controller (as defined by European Data Protection Laws) unless otherwise described in Annex C (Jurisdiction-Specific Terms) of this DPA.</p>
<p>2.2 <strong>Purpose limitation.</strong> Mailchimp shall process Customer Data, as further described in Annex A (Details of Data Processing) of this DPA, only in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions as set forth in this DPA, as necessary to comply with applicable law, or as otherwise agreed in writing (“Permitted Purposes”). The parties agree that the Agreement, including this DPA, along with the Customer’s configuration of or use of any settings, features, or options in the Service (as the Customer may be able to modify from time to time) constitute the Customer’s complete and final instructions to Mailchimp in relation to the processing of Customer Data (including for the purposes of the SCCs), and processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>2.3 <strong>Prohibited data.</strong> Customer will not provide (or cause to be provided) any Sensitive Data to Mailchimp for processing under the Agreement, and Mailchimp will have no liability whatsoever for Sensitive Data, whether in connection with a Security Incident or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, this DPA will not apply to Sensitive Data.</p>
<p>2.4 <strong>Customer compliance.</strong> Customer represents and warrants that (i) it has complied, and will continue to comply, with all applicable laws, including Data Protection Laws, in respect of its processing of Customer Data and any processing instructions it issues to Mailchimp; and (ii) it has provided, and will continue to provide, all notice and has obtained, and will continue to obtain, all consents and rights necessary under Data Protection Laws for Mailchimp to process Customer Data for the purposes described in the Agreement. Customer shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Customer Data and the means by which Customer acquired Customer Data. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for complying with all laws (including Data Protection Laws) applicable to any Campaigns (as defined in the Agreement) or other content created, sent, or managed through the Service, including those relating to obtaining consents (where required) to send emails, the content of the emails and its email deployment practices. </p>
<p>2.5 <strong>Lawfulness of Customer’s instructions.</strong> Customer will ensure that Mailchimp’s processing of the Customer Data in accordance with Customer’s instructions will not cause Mailchimp to violate any applicable law, regulation, or rule, including, without limitation, Data Protection Laws. Mailchimp shall promptly notify Customer in writing, unless prohibited from doing so under European Data Protection Laws, if it becomes aware or believes that any data processing instruction from Customer violates European Data Protection Laws. Where Customer acts as a processor on behalf of a third-party controller (or other intermediary to the ultimate controller), Customer warrants that its processing instructions as set out in the Agreement and this DPA, including its authorizations to Mailchimp for the appointment of Sub-processors in accordance with this DPA, have been authorized by the relevant controller. Customer shall serve as the sole point of contact for Mailchimp and Mailchimp need not interact directly with (including to provide notifications to or seek authorization from) any third-party controller other than through regular provision of the Service to the extent required under the Agreement. Customer shall be responsible for forwarding any notifications received under this DPA to the relevant controller, where appropriate. </p>

        3. Sub-processing    </h2>
    <p>3.1 <strong>Authorized Sub-processors.</strong> Customer agrees that Mailchimp may engage Sub-processors to process Customer Data on Customer’s behalf. The Sub-processors currently engaged by Mailchimp and authorized by Customer are available <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/subprocessors/">here</a>. Mailchimp shall notify Customer if it adds or removes Sub-processors at least 10 days prior to any such changes if Customer opts in to receive such notifications by clicking <a href="https://mailchimp.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=50c94565960030d65d982940e&amp;id=dec9c21452">here</a>.</p>
<p>3.2 <strong>Sub-processor obligations.</strong> Mailchimp shall: (i) enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations that provide at least the same level of protection for Customer Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the service provided by such Sub-processor; and (ii) remain responsible for such Sub-processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-processor that cause Mailchimp to breach any of its obligations under this DPA. Customer acknowledges and agrees that, where applicable, Mailchimp fulfills its obligations under Clause 9 of the 2021 Controller-to-Processor Clauses and 2021 Processor-to-Processor Clauses (as applicable) by complying with this Section 3 and that Mailchimp may be prevented from disclosing Sub-processor agreements to Customer due to confidentiality restrictions but Mailchimp shall, upon request, use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with all relevant information it reasonably can in connection with Subprocessor agreements.</p>

<p>4.4 <strong>Security Incident response.</strong> Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Mailchimp shall: (i) notify Customer without undue delay, and where feasible, within 48 hours of awareness; (ii) provide timely information relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by Customer; and (iii) promptly take reasonable steps to contain and investigate any Security Incident. Mailchimp’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 4.4 shall not be construed as an acknowledgment by Mailchimp of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.</p>
<p>4.5 <strong>Customer responsibilities.</strong> Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that except as provided by this DPA, Customer is responsible for its secure use of the Service, including securing its account authentication credentials, protecting the security of Customer Data when in transit to and from the Service, and taking any appropriate steps to securely encrypt or backup any Customer Data uploaded to the Service.</p>

    <p>5.1 <strong>Audit rights.</strong> Mailchimp shall make available to Customer all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections by Customer in order to assess compliance with this DPA. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it shall exercise its audit rights under this DPA (including this Section 5.1 and where applicable, the SCCs) and any audit rights granted by Data Protection Laws, by instructing Mailchimp to comply with the audit measures described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 below.</p>
<p>5.2 <strong>Security reports.</strong> Customer acknowledges that Mailchimp is regularly audited against industry leading standards by independent third party auditors and internal auditors respectively. Upon written request <a href="/about/security/" title="Security page">here</a>, Mailchimp shall supply (on a confidential basis) a summary copy of its most current audit report(s) (<strong>“Report”</strong>) to Customer, so that Customer can verify Mailchimp’s compliance with the audit standards against which it has been assessed and this DPA.</p>

    <h2>
        6. International Transfers    </h2>
    <p>6.1 <strong>Data center locations.</strong> Subject to Section 6.2, Customer acknowledges that Mailchimp may transfer and process Customer Data to and in the United States and anywhere else in the world where Mailchimp, its Affiliates or its Sub-processors maintain data processing operations. Mailchimp shall at all times ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws and this DPA.</p>
<p>6.2 <strong>Australian data.</strong> To the extent that Mailchimp is a recipient of Customer Data protected by the Australian Privacy Law, the parties acknowledge and agree that Mailchimp may transfer such Customer Data outside of Australia as permitted by the terms agreed upon by the parties and subject to Mailchimp complying with this DPA and the Australian Privacy Law.</p>
<p>6.3 <strong>EEA Data Transfers.</strong> To the extent that Mailchimp is a recipient of Customer Data protected by GDPR in a country outside of EEA that is not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data (as described in applicable European Data Protection Laws), the parties agree to abide by and process such Customer Data in compliance with the SCCs, which shall be incorporated into and form an integral part of this DPA.</p>
<p>6.4 <strong>UK Data Transfers.</strong> With respect to transfers to which the UK Data Protection Laws apply, the SCCs shall apply and shall be deemed amended as specified by the UK Addendum. The UK Addendum shall be deemed executed by the parties and incorporated into and form an integral part of this DPA. In addition: Tables 1 to 3 in Part 1 of the UK Addendum shall be deemed completed with the information set out in Annexes I and II of the relevant SCCs; and Table 4 in Part 1 of the UK Addendum shall be deemed completed by selecting "neither party".</p>
<p>6.5 <strong>Swiss Data Transfers.</strong> With respect to transfers to which the Swiss DPA apply, the SCCs shall apply in accordance with Section 6.3 with the following modifications: (i) references to "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" shall be interpreted as references to the Swiss DPA; (ii) references to specific Articles of "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" shall be replaced with the equivalent article or section of the Swiss DPA; (iii) references to "EU", "Union" and "Member State law" shall be replaced with "Switzerland"; (iv) Clause 13(a) and Part C of Annex Il shall be deleted; (v) references to the "competent supervisory authority" and "competent courts" shall be replaced with "the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner" and "relevant courts in Switzerland"; (vi) Clause 17 shall be replaced to state "The Clauses are governed by the laws of Switzerland"; and (vii) Clause 18 shall be replaced to state "Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the applicable courts of Switzerland. The parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts".</p>
<p>6.6 <strong>Compliance with the SCCs.</strong> The parties agree that if Mailchimp cannot ensure compliance with the SCCs, it shall promptly inform Customer of its inability to comply. If Customer intends to suspend the transfer of European Data and/or terminate the affected parts of the Service, it shall first provide notice to Mailchimp and provide Mailchimp with a reasonable period of time to cure such non-compliance, during which time Mailchimp and Customer shall reasonably cooperate to agree what additional safeguards or measures, if any, may be reasonably required. Customer shall only be entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the affected parts of the Service for non-compliance with the SCCs if Mailchimp has not or cannot cure the non-compliance within a reasonable period.</p>
<p>6.7 <strong>Alternative transfer mechanism.</strong> To the extent Mailchimp adopts an alternative lawful data transfer mechanism for the transfer of European Data not described in this DPA (“Alternative Transfer Mechanism”), the Alternative Transfer Mechanism shall apply instead of the transfer mechanisms described in this DPA (but only to the extent such Alternative Transfer Mechanism complies with applicable European Data Protection Laws and extends to the countries to which European Data is transferred). In addition, if and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or supervisory authority orders (for whatever reason) that the measures described in this DPA cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer European Data (within the meaning of applicable European Data Protection Laws), Mailchimp may implement any additional measures or safeguards that may be reasonably required to enable the lawful transfer of European Data.</p>

    <p>Deletion or return on termination.

The parties agree that the certification of deletion of Customer Data described in Clause 8.5 and 16(d) of the 2021 Controller-to-Processor Clauses and 2021 Processor-to-Processor Clauses (as applicable) shall be provided by Mailchimp to Customer only upon Customer’s written request. </p>

In addition, Mailchimp shall, considering the nature of the processing, provide reasonable additional assistance to Customer to the extent possible to enable Customer (or its third-party controller) to comply with its data protection obligations with respect to data subject rights under Data Protection Laws. In the event that any such request is made to Mailchimp directly, Mailchimp shall not respond to such communication directly except as appropriate (for example, to direct the data subject to contact Customer) or legally required, without Customer’s prior authorization. If Mailchimp is required to respond to such a request, Mailchimp shall, where the Customer is identified or identifiable from the request, promptly notify Customer and provide Customer with a copy of the request unless Mailchimp is legally prohibited from doing so. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Agreement (including this DPA) shall restrict or prevent Mailchimp from responding to any data subject or data protection authority requests in relation to personal data for which Mailchimp is a controller.</p>
<p>8.2 <strong>Data protection impact assessment.</strong> To the extent required under applicable Data Protection Laws, Mailchimp shall (considering the nature of the processing and the information available to Mailchimp) provide all reasonably requested information regarding the Service to enable Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities as required by Data Protection Laws. Mailchimp shall comply with the foregoing by: (i) complying with Section 5 (Security Reports and Audits); (ii) providing the information contained in the Agreement, including this DPA; and (iii) if the foregoing sub-sections (i) and (ii) are insufficient for Customer to comply with such obligations, upon request, providing additional reasonable assistance (at Customer’s expense).</p>

If no such resolution can be reached, Mailchimp will, at its sole discretion, either not appoint such Sub-processor, or permit Customer to suspend or terminate the affected Service in accordance with the termination provisions in the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by Customer prior to suspension or termination).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Government data access requests. As a matter of general practice, Mailchimp does not voluntarily provide government agencies or authorities (including law enforcement) with access to or information about Mailchimp accounts (including Customer Data). If Mailchimp receives a compulsory request (whether through a subpoena, court order, search warrant, or other valid legal process) from any government agency or authority (including law enforcement) for access to or information about a Mailchimp account (including Customer Data) belonging to a Customer whose primary contact information indicates the Customer is located in Europe, Mailchimp shall: (i) review the legality of the request; (ii) inform the government agency that Mailchimp is a processor of the data; (iii) attempt to redirect the agency to request the data directly from Customer; (iv) notify Customer via email sent to Customer’s primary contact email address of the request to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; and (v) provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to the agency or authority based on a reasonable interpretation of the request. As part of this effort, Mailchimp may provide Customer’s primary and billing contact information to the agency. Mailchimp shall not be required to comply with this paragraph 2 if it is legally prohibited from doing so, or it has a reasonable and good-faith belief that urgent access is necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to any individual, public safety, or Mailchimp’s property, the Mailchimp Site, or Service, but where Mailchimp is legally prohibited from notifying Customer of requests it shall use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition.</p>
